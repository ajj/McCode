SciPDL is a kitchen sink, which I originally created to be a one-click install for everything me and my buddies needed to get our astro done.

I’d love to have a script do this automatically but fear it might be complicated.

Basically I compile and install everything (pgplot etc.) on MY Mac system,  making sure I have removed shared versions of libraries to force a static link, and pack it all up with the apple package manager. Then I get someone else to install it and then they complain to me about shared libs I missed! It normally takes 1-2 iterations.

Now I gather the apple package manager is now deprecated as a standard alone item, and you are supposed to do something complicated in Xcode GUI. However it still seems to work for me - but does anyone have any comment about that? I am not an expert in how all these things are supposed to interrelate. Using the Apple PM is good as it provides a familiar (to Mac users at least) click-to-install interface.

I don’t know how this could be done automatically - though the packages are just XML files + directories zipped up I think?

One problem with my approach is I use the system perl which changes with every 10.x OS version and breaks the install. I can only run my thing on whatever OS X version I have at the time,
